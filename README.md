One of the biggest online marketplaces in the world, Amazon, has a variety of difficulties, such as rivalry from other marketplaces, the requirement to uphold consumers' confidence, and the requirement to improve their product selections and price policies. With a greater understanding of the correlations between product price, sales, and discounts because of the data in this dataset, Amazon may be able to build more effective pricing and product strategies that will boost sales and improve customer happiness. 


**Business Questions:**

The two business questions we will be addressing using this dateset are:
